							<h2>An Overview<br /></h2>
							<p>Between my first few years of high school and now, I feel that my attitude and thoughts regarding 
								poetry have shifted vastly. I've also found that my views on poetry as a STEM major tend to deviate 
								from those of other STEM majors, who typically see poetry as boring writing they were forced to read
								in high school. With this project, I attempted to capture these kinds of differences and shifts by 
								comparing the responses I got from a variety of high school and university students. At the center of 
								my approach was a desire to explore how someone's perspective and life experiences impact the way they 
								interact with and feel about poetry. To collect responses, I posted flyers advertising my survey in 
								my old high school and around the UChicago campus. In total, 25 students responded, with 9 from my high 
								school and 18 from UChicago. To get a more involved and annecdotal view of the how perspective plays 
								into poetry, I also personally talked to my younger brother and some friends at UChicago about their 
								relationship with poetry, which partially informed my design of the survey. <br /><br />
								(For context, the quotations I include in the following project come from respondents' answers to 
								questions regarding their favorite poems or types of poetry, what they think makes poetry powerful,
								whether they think poetry is valuable, and, of course, "What is poetry to you?")

						<h2>Themes</h2>
						<p>The primary topics that showed up repeatedly throughout students' responses</p>
					</header>
					<ul class="features">
						<li class="icon solid fa-heart">
							<h3>Emotion</h3>
							<p>By far the most mentioned topic was the power of poetry to invoke strong emotional reactions, 
								which students often connected with vivid imagery and personal expression. <br /><br />
								"There are so many emotions and ideas that can be hard to articulate by mouth, and poetry 
								provides that outlet. It’s a cathartic process for the writer and the reader."
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="icon solid fa-globe">
							<h3>Connection</h3>
							<p>Wether in terms of relating to the experiences poetry describes or feeling a general 
								sense of connection to humanity, numerous respondents emphasized poetry's ability to bring people
								together. <br /><br />
								"Poetry to me is a way I feel connected with humanity and feel less alone. It's a glimpse into 
								possible meanings of life. "
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="icon solid fa-bars">
							<h3>Form</h3>
							<p>Many respondents (especially the high school students) focused on the unique form of
								poetry. They claimed that rhythm, style, and concision make poetry especially 
								impactful. <br /><br />
								"Poetry can be more powerful than prose because it often conveys deep emotions and 
								complex ideas in a concise and impactful way. The rhythm, imagery, and word choice 
								in poetry can evoke strong feelings and create vivid mental pictures that stay with the reader."
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="icon solid fa-user">
							<h3>Personal Ties</h3>
							<p>Several respondents expressed their thoughts on poetry through its connection to their lives. 
								These personal experiences included sharing poetry with family members, composing poetry in 
								the past, and experiencing poetry through religion. <br /><br />
								"My mom read ['Annabel Lee'] to me when I was younger. It was her favorite because she said she felt 
								like a real English speaker when she would read it."
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="icon solid fa-music">
							<h3>Music</h3>
							<p>Unlike university respondents, many high school respondents discussed an appreciation for music as 
								poetry—some even described music as their primary exposure to poetry. <br /><br />
								"I’m not very big into reading, but music has a lot of poetry so I’d say music is my favorite."
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="icon solid fa-comments">
							<h3>Ideas</h3>
							<p>Although few respondents indicated that influencing social change was the most valuable aspect
								of poetry, several responses praised poetry's ability to spread ideas and educate people. <br /><br />
								"Poetry is valuable just as conversations are valuable. I would argue that it’s more valuable, since 
								poetry is a perpetual conversation between multiple parties. It’s the framing of an idea, which is made 
								to transcend or outlast context, in a way that impacts us emotionally and socially even centuries or millennia later. "

							<h2>Favorite Poem</h2>
							<p>
								None of the high school respondents named any particular poems as their favorites, but they were the most 
								diverse in the kinds of poems they liked: epics, limericks, songs, and more. This diversity of genres was 
								accompanied by a general appreciation for entertaining and engaging poems that had "less to do with emotions" 
								and had more of an emphasis on approachability. Conversely, most of the university students mentioned individual poems, 
								and they tended to appreciate poems that described relatable experiences, poems with vivid descriptions, and, as one
								respondent put it, "poetry that manages to vividly communicate a 'vibe' of some kind, to put me in a very particular 
								headspace using only words." Furthermore, respondents who were interested in non-STEM subjects tended to focus more on the 
								emotional impact and personal resonance their favorite poems ellicited than those interested in STEM, who highlighted 
								rhythm and rhyme, detailed descriptions, and personal connections.

							<h2>The Power of Poetry</h2>
							<p>
								I posed this question with respect to prose to make respondents consider poetry's specific attributes that
								make it powerful, rather than considering it as any other kind of writing. Many participants agreed that poetry's 
								form lends it impact, since "removing the rigid conventions of prose allows the poet to express their thoughts freely and play with 
								things like space, sounds, and the feel of the words." Concision was a main focus for many, as they felt that
								each line of poetry held more emotional power than typical writing. Interestingly, the non-STEM students defended prose
								more than STEM students, claiming that any kind of writing can be powerful depending on context. They seemed to take a
								more nuanced approach in their evaluation of poetry's power, and, fittingly, several of them discussed the important role of
								perspective in this question.

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Poetry's Value</h2>
							<p>This open-ended question followed a multiple choice question regarding the most valuable part of poetry. Notably, although
								many students discussed poetry's ability to spread ideas and provoke thought, very few identified the ability to inspire social
								change as poetry's most valuable attribute. Despite most of the high school respondents writing about entertainment being an
								important aspect to them in poetry, only one indicated it as the most valuable aspect of poetry. Possibly, (as supported by several
								students' responses) the high school students do not personally enjoy poetry they found to be "deep" or confusing, but they acknowledged 
								that it holds some value that "has been important enough to so many people that the word 'poetry' exists in the first place." No respondent
								claimed that poetry had no value, even those who said that they did not like poetry.

							<h2>What is poetry to you?</h2>
							<p>
								Quite unanimously, the respondents agreed that poetry is an artform that varies greatly and has no simple definition. A few students
								characterized poetry by its tendency to have rhythm or intentionally structured lines, but most considered poetry through the impact
								poems have left on them or others. One such example was a student who described poetry as any written work that "inspires something 
								in the reader beyond the collection of words that comprise the piece." This tendency to acknowledge the potential of poetry to move people
								rather than discussing their personal connection was especially common amongst the high school students, implying that they might lack
								the experience with poetry that university students gained through their years of schooling. Still, throughout the responses, there was a
								common thread of poetry being "a reflection of the human experience" that can unite, inspire, and leave a lasting impact.
